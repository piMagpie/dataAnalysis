Good job! 

I wasn't quite sure if you had misunderstanding with the spatial CV or not, 
but just to make sure note that the spatial CV is NOT used for selecting some optimal dead zone radius. 

It is just used to investigate the spatial prediction performance of a model. 
In practice it however might be the case that we could say "we shouldn't make predictions farther than 100 meters, because then the model gets too unreliable, based on the results"
